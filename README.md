# 🧠 DSA Practice Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/patilpallavi966/), [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/patilpallavi966/), and others. I'm solving these problems to strengthen my DSA knowledge and prepare for coding interviews.
